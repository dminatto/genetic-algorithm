# Genetic Algorithm

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

## How it works

Five phases are considered in a genetic algorithm.

 1. Initial population
 2. Fitness function
 3. Selection
 4. Crossover
 5. Mutation
